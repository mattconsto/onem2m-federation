\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{
For the mass deployment of the Internet of Things to be a success, a global standard for machine to machine communication needs to become established. In this report, the open oneM2M standard for Machine to Machine communication will be explored. This project will research its capabilities, how to make use of the standard, and ultimately build systems with IoT sensors upon it. Using these systems data streaming, live video and federation will be investigated.\\

This project is research orientated, investigating federation with InterDigital as the client. They created the oneTRANSPORT data marketplace using the oneM2M standard that exposes proprietary data to users, analysts and developers.
